Kelsea Ballerini and Kane Brown are back to host Kane Brown and Kelsea Ballerini Kane Brown and Kelsea Ballerini hosting in 2021. JOHN SHEARER/2021 CMT AWARDS/GETTY IMAGES FOR CMT Ballerini and Brown, both 29, are returning as co-hosts for Ballerini's third time and Brown's fourth to take on the night.

"The CMT Awards are really a true snapshot of the sound of country music right now, and honoring newer artists and collaborations, and things that are pushing boundaries," Ballerini said earlier this week. "I think I can probably speak for both of us to say that that's always where our music's really lain, and something that's important to us."

She continued: "To be able to be on stage and host the show with someone that I feel like I'm really similar to in that way is very cool."

"Our goal is to highlight and complement all of the nominees and amazing performances of the artists there, and just tee them up to do their thing," he said. "I really just try and be me when it comes to hosting."

Last year, Brown joined as co-host when the "Heartfirst" singer tested positive for COVID-19 the morning of the award show and was forced to complete her hosting duties from home.

Robeisy was knocked down by the light-hitting Gonzalez and was unable to rally to make up the difference. In their rematch a year later, Robeisy blanked Gonzales, beating him by a lopsided six round unanimous decision in July 2020.
